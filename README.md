Next Scala Search
=================

The next Scala Search Engine for Scala IDE. Currently there's not much
to see here.

Install it
----------

For the moment only nightlies are available.

Requirements
++++++++++++

* [Install Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/indigo/sr2).
* [Install the Scala IDE nightly for Scala 2.10.x](http://scala-ide.org/download/nightly.html#for_scala_210x).

Update site
+++++++++++

http://scala-ide.dreamhosters.com/nightly-update-scala-search-scalaide-master-210/site/ 

Building
--------

The build is configured using maven so you build by invoking the following:

    mvn clean package
    
Running it
----------

The easiest way to work on the plugin is to import the projects into Eclipse and run it using 
the [Equinox Weaving Launcher](https://github.com/milessabin/equinox-weaving-launcher) plugin.
To install the Equinox Weaving Launcher, use the following Eclipse update site:

[http://www.chuusai.com/eclipse/equinox-weaving-launcher/](http://www.chuusai.com/eclipse/equinox-weaving-launcher/)

This adds the run configuration `Eclipse Application with Equinox Weaving`.
