Report A Bug
------------

File tickets in our [issue tracker](http://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/support/tickets), or drop a message in the [scala-ide-user mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/scala-ide-user) if you have any doubt.

Install it
----------

The latest stable versions can be installed through the update site of the [stable version of the IDE](http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html)

Nightlies can be installed through [this update site](http://scala-ide.dreamhosters.com/nightly-update-scala-search-scalaide-master-211/site/).

Building
--------

Simply run the ``./build.sh`` script.

The scala-search build is based on
[plugin-profiles](https://github.com/scala-ide/plugin-profiles) and
can be built against several versions of the IDE, Eclipse and Scala
compiler.

Running it
----------

The easiest way to work on the plugin is to import the projects into Eclipse and run it using
the Equinox Weaving Launcher plugin. More instructions about it can be found [here](http://scala-ide.org/docs/dev/setup/setup.html#Run_the_Scala_IDE_within_Eclipse).
